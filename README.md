### But what's Al Behd?

Al Behd is a fake language from a game my wife and I love, Final Fantasy 10. She likes to leave me notes sometimes in Al Behd, so I made this translator to make things easier when she does, and it makes it easier to write things back to her. 

All you'll need to do is enter a string you want translated, and then it takes over and outputs the correct translation for you. It'll keep looping until you type 'ESC' or close the application.
