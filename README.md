### But what's Al Behd?

Al Behd is a fake language from a game my wife and I love, Final Fantasy 10. She likes to leave me notes sometimes in Al Behd, so I made this translator to make things easier when she does, and it makes it easier to write things back to her. 

All you'll need to do is choose the language to translate to, enter a string you want translated, and then it takes over and outputs the correct translation for you. It'll keep looping until you type 'ESC' or close the application. You can also type 'MAIN' at any point to go back to the main menu to switch languages. Also now converts grams to ounces because why not? Also provides an easier way to check the validity or correct-ed-ness (new word) of my coding, rather than having to look up a cipher for a fake language from a video game.
